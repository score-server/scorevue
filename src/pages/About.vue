            A couple of friends and I started to create some fun Projects together and are hosting it under this domain. So don't be confused if you randomly find a subdomain or link that doesn't exist anymore. <br>
            To check out some of our stuff visit our <a href="https://github.com/score-server">Github group</a> and their members.
